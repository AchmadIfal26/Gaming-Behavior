# Online Gaming Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview

This project analyzes an online gaming behavior dataset to understand various aspects of player behavior, preferences, and game engagement. The analysis includes demographic insights, game genre popularity, in-game purchasing behavior, game difficulty preferences, session frequency and duration, and player level and achievements.

## Dataset

The dataset `online_gaming_behavior_dataset.csv` contains the following columns:

- `PlayerID`: Unique identifier for each player.
- `Age`: Age of the player.
- `Gender`: Gender of the player.
- `Location`: Geographic location of the player.
- `GameGenre`: Genre of the game played.
- `PlayTimeHours`: Total hours played.
- `InGamePurchases`: Total amount spent on in-game purchases.
- `GameDifficulty`: Preferred game difficulty level.
- `SessionsPerWeek`: Number of gaming sessions per week.
- `AvgSessionDurationMinutes`: Average duration of each gaming session in minutes.
- `PlayerLevel`: Current level of the player.
- `AchievementsUnlocked`: Number of achievements unlocked by the player.

## Objectives

1. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and prepare the data for analysis.
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Perform various analyses and visualizations to understand player behavior and game engagement.

## Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Handle Missing Values**: Checked for and handled any missing values.
2. **Remove Duplicates**: Removed duplicate entries to ensure data accuracy.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

### Demographic Analysis

1. **Age Distribution of Players**:
    - Visualized the age distribution of players using a histogram with KDE plot.
2. **Gender Proportion of Players**:
    - Visualized the gender proportion of players using a pie chart.

### Game Genre Analysis

1. **Popular Game Genres**:
    - Visualized the distribution of game genres using a count plot.
2. **Playtime by Game Genre**:
    - Visualized the total playtime for each game genre using a bar chart.

### In-Game Purchasing Analysis

1. **Total In-Game Purchases**:
    - Calculated the total in-game purchases made by players.
2. **In-Game Purchases by Game Genre**:
    - Visualized the in-game purchases for each game genre using a bar chart.

### Game Difficulty Analysis

1. **Player Preferences for Game Difficulty**:
    - Visualized the distribution of preferred game difficulty levels using a count plot.

### Session Frequency and Duration Analysis

1. **Session Frequency Distribution**:
    - Visualized the distribution of gaming sessions per week using a histogram with KDE plot.
2. **Average Session Duration**:
    - Visualized the distribution of average session duration using a histogram with KDE plot.

### Player Level and Achievements Analysis

1. **Player Level Distribution**:
    - Visualized the distribution of player levels using a histogram with KDE plot.
2. **Achievements Unlocked Distribution**:
    - Visualized the distribution of achievements unlocked by players using a histogram with KDE plot.

### Correlation Analysis

1. **Correlation Between Factors**:
    - Analyzed the correlation between different numerical factors using a heatmap.

### Player Location Analysis

1. **Player Distribution by Location**:
    - Visualized the distribution of players by location using a pie chart.

## Save Cleaned Data

The cleaned and processed dataset is saved as `Gaming_Fix.csv`.

## Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

After installing the necessary libraries, you can run the analysis script provided in this repository.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into the behavior and preferences of online gamers. The visualizations and analysis help in understanding the demographics, game genre popularity, in-game purchasing behavior, and other key aspects of online gaming behavior.
